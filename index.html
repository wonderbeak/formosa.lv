			<h4><a href="https://www.facebook.com/alisha.ro.10" title="Alesya Misa">Alisha</a></h4>

		<p>Our most experienced, exciting and extraordinary guide. Alisha has been the main guide for Asian guests for more than a decade. Her special approach to "guiding" is the foundation on which Farmosa is built. She sees guides as people who introduce their old friends (the city) to their new acquaintances (guests). In her opinion, this interaction usually brings out the best in all parties.</p>
